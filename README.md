# minidots

A minimal set of dotfiles meant for use on Linux servers that use Vim and Bash.

Install by cloning the repo into your home directory, then running `install.sh`, which creates symlinks that place each file or directory in the location expected by the program it is meant to configure.
`install.sh` will not overwrite existing files, which you will have to manually remove if you want to use the version in this repository.
